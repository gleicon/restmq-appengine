RestMQ - Appengine version
Simple Message Queue which uses REST routes, HTTP as transport layer and JSON as payload/protocol.
This one can be seen running at http://jsonqueue.appspot.com.
Protocol is simple and uses an API Key.
There is a twisted/redis version too somewhere.

-- Quick Howto -----

http://jsonqueue.appspot.com/admin
create your API Key and save it. You may regenerate it later.

{
	"cmd": "add",
	"queue": "genesis",
        "value": "abacab",
        "apikey":"your-api-key"
}

{
	 "cmd": "add",
	 "queue": "genesis",
	 "value": "turn it on",
         "apikey":"your-api-key"
}

{
	 "cmd": "add",
	 "queue": "genesis",
	 "value": {"composer": "phil collins",
"drummer":"phil collins"},
         "apikey":"your-api-key"
}

http://jsonqueue.appspot.com/stats/genesis - 3 items on backlog

{
	 "cmd": "take",
	 "queue": "genesis",
         "apikey":"your-api-key"
}

http://jsonqueue.appspot.com/stats/genesis - 2 items on backlog

{
	 "cmd": "get",
	 "queue": "genesis",
         "apikey":"your-api-key"
}

do this 2 times, there must be a count field, which is incremented with every get request.

{"queue": "genesis", "count": 1, "key": "aglqc29ucXVldWVyEQsSClF1ZXVlTW9kZWwYyRoM", "value": "turn it on"}

do whatever you want to do and delete this item using the key attribute (which is unique between queue items)

{
	 "cmd": "del",
	 "queue": "genesis",
 	 "key":"aglqc29ucXVldWVyEQsSClF1ZXVlTW9kZWwYyRoM",
         "apikey":"your-api-key"
}

check stats again, there must be just one item in the backlog
http://jsonqueue.appspot.com/stats/genesis


key - queue item unique id
apikey - your API Key
cmd - which command is meant to be executed
value - any json object you wish to put in the queue.
